R15.18
The union of two sets A and B is the set of all elements that are contained in A, B, or both. The intersection is the set
of all elements that are contained in A and B. How can you compute the union and intersection of two sets, using the add
and contains methods, together with an iterator?



R15.19
How can toy compute the union and intersectio nof two sets, using some of the meothods that the java.util.Set interface
provides, but without using an iterator? (Look up the interface in the API documentation)
