    Chapter 19 
-------------------

1. A stream is an immutable sequence of values that are processed lazily. Lazy processing means to defer
opertions until they are needed, and to skip those that arae not needed. (pp. 847)

2. The Stream.of static method and the stream methods of collection classes yield streams. (848)

3. To turn a stream into an array or collection, use the toArray or collect methods. (850)

4. The map method applie a function to all elements of a stream, yielding another stream. (852)

5. The filter method yields a stream of all elements fulfillingf a condition. (853)

6. A lambda expression consists of one or more parameter variables, an arrow ->, and an expression or 
block yielding the result. (855)

7. A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method. A lambda expression can be converted to an instance
of a functional interface (856)

8. The Optional class is a wrapper for objects that may or may not be present. (859)

9. Use the orElse method to obtain the value fo an Optional or, if no value is present, an alternative. (860)

10. A terminal operation triggers the lazy operations on a stream and yields a non-stream value. (862)
