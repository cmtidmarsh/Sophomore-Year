1. The if statement allows a program to carry out different actions deepending on the nature of the data to be processed.
2. use relational operators to compare numbers.
3. Relational operators compare values. The == operator tests for equality.
4. When comparing floating point numbers, dont test for equality instead check whether they are close enough
5. Do not use the == operator to compare strings. Use the equals methodd instead.
6. The compareTo method compares strings in lexicographic order.
7. The == operator tests whether two object references are identical. To compare the contents of objects, you need to use the equals methods.
8. The null reference fers to no object
9. Multiple if statements can be combined to eval. complex decisions.
10. When using multiple if statements, test gen. conditions after more specific conditions

Chap 6

1. A loop executes instructions repeatedly while a condition is true.
2. Hand tracing can help you understand how an unfamiliar algorithm
3. Hand tracing can show errors in code
4. The for loop is used when a value runs from a starting point to an ending ppoint with a constant inscrement or decrement.

Chap 7
1. an array collects a sequence of values of the same type
2. individual elements in an array are accessed by an int. by an int Index i, use the notation array[i]
3. an array elemt can be used like any variable
4. an array index must be at least 0 and less than the size of the array
5. A bounds error, which occurs if you supply an invalid array index, can cause your program to terminate.


Chap 8
1. a class should represent a single concept from a problem domain such as business, science, or math
2. The public interface of a class sis cohesive if all of its features are related to the concept that the class represents
3. a ckass depends on another class if its methods use that class in anyway 
4. an immutable class has no mutator methods
5/ references to objects of an immutabble class can be safely shared
6. a sude effect if a method is any externall observable data mod.
7. when designing methods, minimize side effects
8. an instance variable for the total is updated in methods that increase or decrease the total amount.
9. a counter that counts events is inscremented in methods that correspond to the events.
10. an object can collect other objects in an array or array list.
