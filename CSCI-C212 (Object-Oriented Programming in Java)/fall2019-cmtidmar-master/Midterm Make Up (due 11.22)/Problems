Here's your Midterm Makeup (take-home, of course):
Solve the following problems,
upload them to your GitHub then
come turn them in to me in person in IF 2010.
When you do so, come prepared to take questions on your programs.

Here are the problems:

P6.9, P6.10 on pp. 300-301
P6.6, P6.7 on pp. 299-300
choose one: E6.14 or E6.22 on pp. 296-297
So this is a total of 5 (five) programs.
