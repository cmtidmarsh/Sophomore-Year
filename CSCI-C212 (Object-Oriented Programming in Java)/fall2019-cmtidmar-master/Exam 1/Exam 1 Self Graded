Write Java Code to calculate the following expressions with Big Decimal objects:
1. Self: 20, Actual: 20             +1
2. Self: 20, Actual: 20             +1

                             Total: 2/2
Evaluate the follow Java Expressions:
3. Self: 4,       Actual: 4         +1
4. Self: 7,       Actual: -7        +0.5 basic mistake, forgot to put a - sign
5. Self: 5/12,    Actual: 3         Forgot that in Java it still reduces
6. Self: 4,       Actual: 3         Forgot that 4 can go into 15 3 times with a remainder of 3
7. Self: 4,       Actual: 4         +1
8. Self: 3,       Actual: 3         +1
9. Self: -4,      Actual: -4        +1
10. Self: 7,      Actual: 3         Forgot that the remainder would be 3
11. Self: True,   Actual: True      +1
12. Self: False,  Actual: False     +1
13. Self: gpl,    Actual: gpl       +1
14. Self: 4,      Actual: 4         +1
15. Self: 5,      Actual: 4         I believe I forgot to start from 0 as the frist character, \(0), \(1), \n(next line), m(2), \(3), "(4)
16. Self: N/A     Actual: 1         Forgot to answer the problem but it should be 1 because 2 goes into 3 once
17. Self: 1.5,    Actual: 1.5       +1

                             Total: 9.5/15
Assuming n is an int with a value of 5, what do these expressions evaluate to:
18. Self: 5,      Actual: 6         Mixed up problems 18 and 19, if ++ is before the variable, 1+value of variable before operation
19. Self: 6,      Actual: 5         Mixed up problems 18 and 19, if ++ is after the variable, do the operation then add 1
20. Self: false,  Actual: false     +1
21. Self: true,   Actual: False      I made the mistake in 18 and 19, so it should be 6 > 6, which is false.
22. Self: -1,     Actual: -1        +1
23. Self: true,   Actual: true      +1

                             Total: 3/6

Assuming that a is a boolean variable what is the value of these expressions:
24. Self: false, Actual: false      +1
25. Self: true,  Actual: true       +1
26. Self: false, Actual: false      +1     
27. Self: true,  Actual: false      false or false = false
28. Self: false, Actual: false      +1
29. Self: true,  Actual: true       +1
                                
                               Total: 5/6

Assuming that a is a boolean variable please simplfy these expressions:
30. Self: N/A,  Actual: false     I forgot that the default boolean value is false.
31. Self: true, Actual: false     Because the statement "false does not equal false" is false. False equals false.          
32. Self: N/A,  Actual:           true, because you're setting a to a boolean which could either be true or false.
33. Self: false, Actual: false    +1
                              
                              Total: 1/4

Assuming that n is an int variable what does these expressions evaluate to:
34. Self: 4,    Actual: 4         +1
35. Self: true, Actual: true      +1
36. Self: false, Actual: false    +1
37. Self: false, Actual: false    +1
  
                              Total: 4/4
Determine the balue of n at the end of the following fragments of code:
38. Self: n=1, Actual: n=1        +1
39. Self: n=1, Actual:n=1         +1
40. Self: n=2, Actual:n=2         +1
41. Self: n=1, Actual: n=10?      ??????????????

What is a dangling else? Give an example:
42. Self: A dangling else is when else is not apart of an if statement inside the function
    if (x==3) x = x+1; else x=6;
    
    Actual: A dangling else is an else statement outside of the nested if statements.
    if (x==3)
        if (x==2)
            x = x + 1;
    else
        x = 6;
        
   +0.5, based on what a dangling else actually is, I feel like I got the description correct, but the example was missing a  couple lines.

Assuming that a has a boolean value and n is an int please simplify the following expressions:
43. Self: false == true,    Actual: a = false   I didn't study/understand how to simply expressions
44. Self: true != false,    Actual: a = true    Didn't understand how to simply expressions
45. Self: true && false,    Actual: a = true    Didn't understand how to simply expressions
46. Self: if (n !=3) a = false; else a = true; , Actual: a = false
47. Self: if (n==3) a = true; else a = false;  , Actual: a = false
48. Self: a = false; if (n==4) a = true;    , Actual: .......
49. Self: if (n>1) a = false; else a = true  , Actual: ......

                                              Total: 0/7

Are these two fragments equivalent? Why or why not?
50. Self: Yes, because if 8==8 then do n = n+3. If n!=8 (does not equal 8) else then n = 5. 
    Actual: Yes.
